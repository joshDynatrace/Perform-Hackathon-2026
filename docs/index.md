# Vegas Casino - Observability Hackathon

Welcome to the **Vegas Casino** project documentation! This is a microservices-based casino application designed specifically for observability hackathons where attendees will improve instrumentation and application pipelines.

## 🎰 What is Vegas Casino?

Vegas Casino is a comprehensive microservices application that simulates a real-world casino environment. It's built with multiple services using different programming languages and technologies, making it an ideal platform for:

- **Observability Practice**: Learn and implement distributed tracing, metrics, and logging
- **Feature Flag Management**: Experiment with OpenFeature and flagd for feature toggling
- **Load Testing**: Test application performance under various conditions
- **DevOps Practices**: Practice CI/CD, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build all Docker images
make docker-build-all

# Deploy using Helm
helm install vegas-casino ./helm/vegas-casino

# Run Playwright automation
kubectl apply -f helm/vegas-casino/templates/playwright-deployment.yaml

# Run k6 load tests
kubectl apply -f helm/vegas-casino/templates/k6-deployment.yaml
```
