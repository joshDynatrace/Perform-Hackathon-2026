## Gather Details: Tenant ID & Environment

You will need access to a Dynatrace tenant. If you do not have access, [sign up for a free 15 day trial](https://dt-url.net/trial){target=_blank}.

Make a note of your Dynatrace tenant ID. It is the first bit of your URL (eg. `abc12345` in the following examples):

```
https://abc12345.live.dynatrace.com
https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com
```

## Gather Details: Environment Type

Make a note of your "environment type" based on your URL.

If you are unsure, use `live`.

| abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com | live |
| abc12345.live.dynatrace.com | live |
| abc12345.sprint.dynatracelabs.com | sprint |
